          Beyond his culinary genius and the exquisite design of both his food
          and restaurants, Chef Morimotoâ€™s business acumen has helped him
          succeed in other related industries. Morimoto Signature Series of beer
          was launched in 2003 in partnership with Rogue Ales of Newport,
          Oregon. Chef Morimoto also has a line of premium sakes produced in
          collaboration with the Fukumitsuya Brewery, a prominent sake brewery
          in Kanazawa, Japan that was founded in 1625. In 2016, Chef added
          Morimoto grape-seed oil, and Morimoto wine produced in collaboration
          with Michael Mondavi.
