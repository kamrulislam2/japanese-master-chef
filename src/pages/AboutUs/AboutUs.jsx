        Beyond his culinary genius and the exquisite design of both his food and
        restaurants, Chef Morimotoâ€™s business acumen has helped him succeed in
        other related industries. Morimoto Signature Series of beer was launched
        in 2003 in partnership with Rogue Ales of Newport, Oregon. Chef Morimoto
        also has a line of premium sakes produced in collaboration with the
        Fukumitsuya Brewery, a prominent sake brewery in Kanazawa, Japan that
        was founded in 1625. In 2016, Chef added Morimoto grape-seed oil, and
        Morimoto wine produced in collaboration with Michael Mondavi.
